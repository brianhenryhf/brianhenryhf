Hi - I'm Brian, a polyglot software master craftsman. I've delivered responsive SPA and traditional server web apps, MQ-driven async backend processing pipelines, and CI/CD/DevOps workflows. I'm fluent in Ruby/Rails, Node.js/JS/TS, Java/JEE, and a few other langs/frameworks, but I always welcome the chance to learn more. I'm amply capable with assorted RDBMS's, stored procs, etc., and set up ElasticSearch, Mongo, or Redis clusters as well. I adapt easily, but I'm primed by experience for environments like AWS, GCP, or Azure.

I'm proficient in all aspects of the SDLC, from detailed requirements analysis to heads-down coding. I enjoy teasing out requirements and planning execution of new product features. I'm also a seasoned maintenance dev.

I'm a self-directed problem-solver. But, I'm also driven to boost the success of my colleagues, through mentorship and knowledge-sharing.
