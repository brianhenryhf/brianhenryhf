# Who is Brian
I'm Brian Henry, a polyglot senior software engineer with a lengthy record of success delivering all tiers of web and enterprise applications. I design and craft solutions rooted in technologies like Java/JEE/Spring, Ruby/Rails, and Node.js, backing them with various RDBMS/NoSQL data stores and message queues, and building dynamic and responsive classic and JS-based SPA front-ends.

I'm proficient in all aspects of the SDLC, from detailed requirements analysis to efficient heads-down coding, and take pride in delivering well-tested artifacts, on-time. I'm a self-directed problem-solver who elevates teams with experience, collaboration, and mentorship.

# I'm currently working on
- Being a better software technician - learning my tools and improving on underlying theory
- Expanding my sphere of knowledge - always primed to pursue the next level or the lateral domains
- Getting better at sharing and guiding - perpetually room to grow there, and plenty to give
- Some woodworkssing, and ;k

# Iâ€™m currently learning
- I'm T-shaped and the T stem is currently shifting to C# or Typescript.
- I am unquenchably always learning something, and tomorrow it may be d3 for graphing, kinesis stream wrangling, dotnet's DI framework (or LINQ), etc

#  Iâ€™m looking for help with 
- I'm really excited to further a goal that is close to making people happy, in a meaningful way.  For example, medical advance that heals cancer. or something that makes oldsters less lonely.
